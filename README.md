## Purpose
This project was made to help Elements Solar to do site inspections easier. While working at Elements Solar, I 
noticed that we took pictures of the homes and we would try to remember information about the home or we would type it into
a notes app on our phones. After noticing that my photos app was cluttered with pictures of random houses, I knew I needed to do 
something about it. So I created this app in order to solve this problem and while working on it, I added some more features
that made this app very useful.
